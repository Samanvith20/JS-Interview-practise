    Explian about the Polyfill feature in the context of web development. A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) that provides functionality that is not natively supported by a web browser. It allows developers to use modern web features while ensuring compatibility with older browsers that do not support those features natively.
</h1>
<h1>
    Polyfills are particularly useful for implementing new web standards or APIs that may not yet be widely adopted across all browsers. By including a polyfill in your project, you can write code that uses these modern features without worrying about whether the user's browser supports them.

<h2>
    Why are polyfills important?
✅ For browser compatibility:

Users might have older browsers.

You want your app to work for them.

✅ For progressive enhancement:

Use modern features without breaking old browsers.

“If the browser doesn’t support it, I’ll polyfill it.”

✅ For future-proofing:

You can write modern code now.

Users get a consistent experience.
